# Learning Unit Testing

This repository is created to learn how to write unit tests in Python.

## What is a unit test?
A unit test is a type of automated software testing that verifies individual units of code, such as functions or methods, work as intended. Unit tests are used to ensure that each part of the code performs as expected and can help catch and fix bugs early in the development process.

## Why are unit tests useful?
Unit tests provide several benefits for software development:
* **Catch bugs early**: Unit tests help catch bugs early in the development process, before they become more difficult and expensive to fix.
* **Improve code quality**: Unit tests can help improve code quality by ensuring each part of the code works as intended and meets the requirements.
* **Facilitate code changes**: Unit tests provide a safety net when making changes to the code, ensuring that the changes don't introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.
* **Increase confidence**: Unit tests give developers confidence that their code works as intended and can be integrated with other parts of the codebase.
